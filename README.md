# Fruit Detection Using YOLOv8

This was part of my final semester project of the Artificial Intelligence subject.
The model was trained using 300 sample images of apple, orange, banana, and mix of all three.
Trained using 40 epochs, and deployed locally using OpenCV library.

This code has specific folder structure and placement, so make sure to follow mine or adjust the code tou your own wtructure.

To use this, it is recommended to use GPU for quicker training time.
To deploy the model, here are some of the requirements:
1) Install Anaconda Navigator
2) Create environment and install Ultralytics library.
3) You're good to go!
